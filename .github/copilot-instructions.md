# Copilot Instructions

<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This is an Express.js project built with TypeScript.

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Enable strict typing (`strict: true` in tsconfig).
- Use explicit types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
- Prefer interfaces and types for object shapes.
- Avoid using `any`; use unknown or proper types.
- Use enums for sets of related constants.
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (e.g., `Partial`, `Pick`, `Record`).
- Organize code into modules for maintainability.
- Use type guards and assertions where necessary.
- Keep code DRY and avoid duplication.
- Document types and interfaces with JSDoc comments.

## Additional Recommendations

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
- Write unit and integration tests for critical logic.
- Document API endpoints and usage in a README or with OpenAPI/Swagger.
