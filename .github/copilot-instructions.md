## TypeScript Best Practices

- Always implement best practices for TypeScript.
  - Use strict typing.
  - Prefer interfaces over types where appropriate.
  - Avoid using `any`.
  - Use explicit return types for functions.
  - Organize imports and exports clearly.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions.
  - Document public APIs and complex logic.
  - ADD comprehensive JSDoc comments for all interfaces and schemas.
  - Ensure code style consistency by configuring and using Prettier and ESLint with recommended settings for TypeScript projects.
