# Domain-Driven Design Architecture Setup

Generate a well-structured folder hierarchy following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles for this Express.js TypeScript project.

## Requirements
- Create the folder structure inside `/src`
- Follow DDD architectural patterns
- Separate concerns between domains, application services, and infrastructure
- Include proper TypeScript organization
- Consider scalability and maintainability

## Expected Structure
The architecture should include:
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Use cases, application services, DTOs
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, APIs, frameworks)
- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, routes, middleware
- **Shared/Common**: Cross-cutting concerns, utilities, types

## Additional Considerations
- Include configuration management
- Add proper separation for tests
- Consider dependency injection structure
- Include validation and error handling organization
- Add documentation structure

Please create a comprehensive folder structure that supports clean architecture principles and TypeScript best practices.
